## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

INTRODUCTION

In this report we will analyze data for a research study that covers the following topic: Alveolar Macrophages after Murine Lung Transplant. For this we have the following resources provided:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116583

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AqYi0Ps5t5xo6XYWXjOtO6eDOMpT1ADE - Google drive folder with the following content:

- meta_data
- salmon-quant
- tx2gene.csv


The project name BMS353-Alveolar-Macrophages---RNA-seq-dataset with all files and the code are available on github in a repository:
